# UPGMA
bioinformatics project2 using UPGMA and bootstrapping to find the closet clade.

1. get the distance from k2p. 
2. build a UPGMA cladogram:
    a. build the Newick format representation of the group.
    b. Get the new distance
    c. identify the smallest pairwise distance; join those sequences into a single group
    d. rebuild the cladogram
    e. until there is only one unconnected node.
    f. return the Newick Representation and distance tables
3. run the bootstrapping
4. finish the final paper.
